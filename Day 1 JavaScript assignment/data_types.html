    <h1>Data Types in JavaScript</h1><hr>
    <p>Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.</br>

There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.</br>

Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities.</br></p>
    <h3>String Data Type</h3>
    <p>
        The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:</br>
        var a="Hey, How are you?";</br>
    </p>
    <h3>Number Data Type</h3>
    <p>
        The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).</br>
        Example :</br>
        var a = 25;
    </p>
    <h3>Boolean Data Type</h3>
    <p>
        The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:</br>
        var isReading = true;</br>
    </p>
    <h3>Null Data Type</h3>
    <p>
        This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.</br>

        A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.</br>
        Example :</br>
        var a = null;
    </p>
